It will start a dev container automatically.

See [VS Code: Quick start: Open an existing folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container) for more details.

## How to confirm whether you are ready or not

```bash
# in the host machine
$ docker ps | grep vsc-jsac2023-sbom-workshop-
552de0a989ad   vsc-jsac2023-sbom-workshop-3fca6e376833fdc5e8366e8f0fcde96e   "/bin/sh -c 'echo Coâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute             admiring_hofstadter
```

```bash
# in the dev container

# check poetry is installed
$ poetry --version
Poetry (version 1.2.2)

# check pytest
$ pytest --version
pytest 7.2.0

# check Python app is running
$ curl localhost:8000
{"message":"hello, world!"}

# check Java app is running
$ curl localhost:8080
{"timestamp":"2022-11-12T07:10:56.045+00:00","status":400,"error":"Bad Request","path":"/"}
```

If you fail to check Python/Java app's running status by curl, please execute the following command.

```bash
# the script kicks off the apps
/app/postStartCommand.sh

# then it will work
curl localhost:8000
curl localhost:8080
```

If you still have the issue, please rebuild the container.

Note that Python requirements for the hands-on challenges are installed in the virtual environment via Poetry. It is activated by default.

```bash
$ python ...
$ pytest ...
# or
$ deactivate
$ poetry run python ...
$ poetry run pytest
```
