## 5. SBOM based vulnerability detection with OSV

### The challenge

Detect vulnerabilities in generated SBOMs in the previous challenges by using [google/osv-scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner), the official OSV based scanner by Google.

> OSV-Scanner provides an officially supported frontend to the OSV database that connects a projectâ€™s list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities that affect them.
