## 3. Site packages based Python SBOM generation

### Demystifying Python Module Search Path

(https://xkcd.com/1987/ by Randall Munroe)


```bash
$ python -c "import sys;print(sys.path)"
['', '/usr/local/lib/python310.zip', '/usr/local/lib/python3.10', '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload', '/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages', '/workspaces/jsac2023']
```

| Path                            | Desc.                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `~/lib/pythonXY.zip`            | Zipped standard libraries |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y`               | Standard libraries        |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y/lib-dynload`   | Standard C libraries      |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` | Third party libraries     |

```bash
$ python -c "import site;print(site.getsitepackages())"
['/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages']

# or
$ python -m site
sys.path = [
    '/workspaces/jsac2023',
    '/usr/local/lib/python310.zip',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.10',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload',
    '/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages',
]
USER_BASE: '/home/vscode/.local' (exists)
USER_SITE: '/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages' (exists)
ENABLE_USER_SITE: False
```

- System site: system level site packages
- User site: user (virtual environment) level site packages

By default, a virtual environment is entirely isolated from the system-level site-packages.([PEP405](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/))

### pkg_resources module

> The `pkg_resources` module distributed with setuptools provides an API for Python libraries to access their resource files, and for extensible applications and frameworks to automatically discover plugins. It also provides runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python’s current “working set” of active packages.
>
> --- https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html


```python
import pkg_resources

# ref. https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#getting-or-creating-distributions
for dist in pkg_resources.find_distributions(site_package):
    print([dist.project_name, dist.version])
```

### The challenge

Implement a function to get site packages from a Python process and produce a list of CylcloneDX components.

- Implement `get_site_packages()` in `jsac2023/python/site_packages.py`
- A CycloneDX component should have `name`, `version` and `purl`
- Use `pypi` as a PackageURL type. (e.g. `pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.1`)

### How to test the challenge

The following test tries to test the function with `tests/fixtures/gradle.lockfile` (= `/app/log4j-vulnerable-app/gradle.lockfile` in the dev container)

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_site_packages.py
```

Also you can produce CycloneDX SBOM with the following command along with the function.

```bash
jsac2023-cli python site-packages | jq .
```

### Hints for the challenge

Again, the virtual environment is Matryoshka!

```bash
$ cd /workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop
$ poetry run python -m http.server 8888
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8888 (http://0.0.0.0:8888/) ...
```

You can find the virtual environment of the above process in `cmdline`.

| Name    | Value                                                                     |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| exe     | /usr/local/bin/python3.10                                                 |
| cwd     | /workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop                                        |
| cmdline | `/workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop/.venv/bin/python` -m http.server 8888 |
