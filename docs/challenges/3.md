## Demystifying Python Module Search Path

![img](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)

(https://xkcd.com/1987/ by Randall Munroe)

```bash
$ python -c "import sys;print(sys.path)"
['', '/usr/local/lib/python310.zip', '/usr/local/lib/python3.10', '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload', '/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages', '/workspaces/jsac2023']
```

| Path                            | Desc.                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `~/lib/pythonXY.zip`            | Zipped standard libraries |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y`               | Standard libraries        |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y/lib-dynload`   | Standard C libraries      |
| `~/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` | Third party libraries     |

```bash
$ python -c "import site;print(site.getsitepackages())"
['/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages']
# or
$ python -m site
sys.path = [
    '/workspaces/jsac2023',
    '/usr/local/lib/python310.zip',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.10',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload',
    '/workspaces/jsac2023/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages',
]
USER_BASE: '/home/vscode/.local' (exists)
USER_SITE: '/home/vscode/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages' (exists)
ENABLE_USER_SITE: False
```

- System site: system level site packages
- User site: user (virtual environment) level site packages

By default, a virtual environment is entirely isolated from the system-level site-packages.([PEP405](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/))

## pkg_resources module

> The `pkg_resources` module distributed with setuptools provides an API for Python libraries to access their resource files, and for extensible applications and frameworks to automatically discover plugins. It also provides runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python’s current “working set” of active packages.
>
> --- https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html

```python
import pkg_resources

# ref. https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#getting-or-creating-distributions
for dist in pkg_resources.find_distributions(site_package):
    print([dist.project_name, dist.version])
```

## The challenge

Implement a function to get site packages from a Python process.

- Implement `get_site_packages()` in `jsac2023/python/site_packages.py`

```python
# jsac2023/python/site_packages.py

def get_site_packages(process: psutil.Process) -> set[str]:
    """Get site packages used by a Python process"""
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

### Notes

- A process is provided to the function as [psutil](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)'s [Process](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#process-class) object
- It is guaranteed that a given process is a Python process
- A function to get components from a site package is already implemented. (`site_package_to_components()`)
- A CycloneDX component should have `name`, `version` and `purl`
- Use `pypi` as a PackageURL type. (e.g. `pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.1`)

### Possible solutions or hints

- Check wether a process is a Python or not (by checking `exe` or `cmdline` of a process)
- Execute `site.getsitepackages()` with the Python used by the process
- A virtual environment is a matryoshka!

```bash
$ cd /workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop
$ poetry run python -m http.server 8888
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8888 (http://0.0.0.0:8888/) ...
```

You can find the virtual environment of the above process in `cmdline`.

| Name    | Value                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exe     | /usr/local/bin/python3.10                                                 |
| cwd     | /workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop                                        |
| cmdline | `/workspaces/jsac2023-sbom-workshop/.venv/bin/python` -m http.server 8888 |

### How to test the challenge

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_site_packages.py
```

Also you can produce CycloneDX SBOM with the following command along with the function.

```bash
jsac2023-cli python site-packages | jq .
```
