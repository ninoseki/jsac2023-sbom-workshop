## 1. Parsing Python's `requirements.txt`

### What is `requirements.txt`

> Requirements files serve as a list of items to be installed by pip, when using pip install. Files that use this format are often called “pip requirements.txt files”, since requirements.txt is usually what these files are named (although, that is not a requirement).
> --- https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#requirements-file-format

```
SomeProject
SomeProject == 1.3
SomeProject >= 1.2, < 2.0
SomeProject[foo, bar]
SomeProject ~= 1.4.2
SomeProject == 5.4 ; python_version < '3.8'
SomeProject ; sys_platform == 'win32'
requests[security] >= 2.8.1, == 2.8.* ; python_version < "2.7"
```

### The challenge

Implement a function to parse `requirements.txt` and produce a list of CylcloneDX components.

- Implement `parse_requirements()` in `jsac2023/python/requirements.py`
- A CycloneDX component should have `name`, `version` and `purl`
- Use `pypi` as a PackageURL type. (e.g. `pkg:pypi/requests@2.28.1`)
  - See [Package URL Type definitions](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst) for more details

### How to test the challenge

The following test tries to test the function with `tests/fixtures/requirements.txt` (= `/app/python-vulnerable-app/requirements.txt` in the dev container)

```bash
pytest tests/python/test_requirements.py
```

Also you can produce CycloneDX SBOM with the following command along with the function.

```bash
jsac2023-cli python requirements /app/python-vulnerable-app/requirements.txt | jq .
```

### Hints for the challenge

- [pkg_resources](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html) provides a function to parse `requirements.txt`

A dependency can have dependencies like Matryoshka.
For example, `fastapi` has [those dependencies](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L41-L44). Can you list up all dependencies?

### Hints for the bonus challenge

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) provides the API to get metadata of a project (= dependency)
  - https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html#project
   - e.g. https://pypi.org/pypi/fastapi/0.86.0/json
