      Apache Log4j vulnerability","details":"# Impact\n\nThe fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
      in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations.
      This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input
      data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either
      a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern
      (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern
      resulting in a remote code execution (RCE) attack. \n\n## Affected packages\nOnly
      the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this
      vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the
      same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure
      compatability if in use.\n\n# Mitigation\n\nLog4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by
      removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality
      by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (\u003c 2.16.0) by
      removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar
      org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).\n\nLog4j 2.15.0 restricts
      JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving
      configuration such as to set the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups`
      to `true` do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability.","aliases":["CVE-2021-45046"],"modified":"2022-09-22T03:52:38.723243Z","published":"2021-12-14T18:01:28Z","database_specific":{"github_reviewed":true,"severity":"CRITICAL","cwe_ids":["CWE-502"]},"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-397453.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-479842.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-661247.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-714170.pdf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EOKPQGV24RRBBI4TBZUDQMM4MEH7MXCY/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SIG7FZULMNK2XF6FZRU4VWYDQXNMUGAJ/"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0032"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44228"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5022"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00646.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/15/3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/18/1"}],"affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.13.0"},{"fixed":"2.16.0"}]}],"versions":["2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.15.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.12.2"}]}],"versions":["2.0","2.0-alpha1","2.0-alpha2","2.0-beta1","2.0-beta2","2.0-beta3","2.0-beta4","2.0-beta5","2.0-beta6","2.0-beta7","2.0-beta8","2.0-beta9","2.0-rc1","2.0-rc2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1","2.10.0","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.11.2","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.2","2.3","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.4","2.4.1","2.5","2.6","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.7","2.8","2.8.1","2.8.2","2.9.0","2.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33.json"}}],"schema_version":"1.3.0","severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}]},{"id":"GHSA-8489-44mv-ggj8","summary":"Improper

      code injection in Log4j","details":"# Summary\n\nLog4j versions prior to 2.16.0
      are subject to a remote code execution vulnerability via the ldap JNDI parser.\nAs
      per [Apache''s Log4j security guide](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html):
      Apache Log4j2 \u003c=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages,
      and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI
      related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters
      can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution
      is enabled. From log4j 2.16.0, this behavior has been disabled by default.\n\nLog4j
      version 2.15.0 contained an earlier fix for the vulnerability, but that patch
      did not disable attacker-controlled JNDI lookups in all situations. For more
      information, see the `Updated advice for version 2.16.0` section of this advisory.\n\n#
      Impact\n\nLogging untrusted or user controlled data with a vulnerable version
      of Log4J may result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) against your application.
      This includes untrusted data included in logged errors such as exception traces,
      authentication failures, and other unexpected vectors of user controlled input.
      \n\n# Affected versions\n\nAny Log4J version prior to v2.15.0 is affected to
      this specific issue.\n\nThe v1 branch of Log4J which is considered End Of Life
      (EOL) is vulnerable to other RCE vectors so the recommendation is to still update
      to 2.16.0 where possible.\n\n## Security releases\nAdditional backports of this
      fix have been made available in versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, and 2.12.3\n\n## Affected
      packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly
      affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should
      be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package
      to ensure compatability if in use.\n\n# Remediation Advice\n\n## Updated advice
      for version 2.16.0\n\nThe Apache Logging Services team provided updated mitigation
      advice upon the release of version 2.16.0, which [disables JNDI by default and
      completely removes support for message lookups](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0).\nEven
      in version 2.15.0, lookups used in layouts to provide specific pieces of context
      information will still recursively resolve, possibly triggering JNDI lookups.
      This problem is being tracked as [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046).
      More information is available on the [GitHub Security Advisory for CVE-2021-45046](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7rjr-3q55-vv33).\n\nUsers
      who want to avoid attacker-controlled JNDI lookups but cannot upgrade to 2.16.0
      must [ensure that no such lookups resolve to attacker-provided data and ensure
      that the the JndiLookup class is not loaded](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3221).\n\nPlease
      note that Log4J v1 is End Of Life (EOL) and will not receive patches for this
      issue. Log4J v1 is also vulnerable to other RCE vectors and we recommend you
